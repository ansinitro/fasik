## 🎨 Video Editing Tips

### Transitions
- Use **fade** transitions between visualizations (0.5-1 second)
- Use **zoom in** effect when introducing a new chart
- Use **pan** effect for wide charts (like correlation heatmap)

### Text Overlays
Add text overlays to highlight key points:
- "88.7% Accuracy!" over model comparison
- "1,500+ Players" over class distribution
- "30+ Features" over feature importance
- "Top Feature: FACEIT ELO" with arrow pointing to top bar

### Color Grading
- Keep visualizations at 100% brightness
- Add slight vignette around edges for focus
- Match background music tempo to animation speed

### Audio
- **Background Music:** Use upbeat, tech-inspired music (search "coding montage music")
- **Sound Effects:** 
  - "Whoosh" when charts appear
  - "Ding" when highlighting best model
  - "Click" sounds during web app demo
- **Voiceover:** Record separately for better quality, then sync

## 📱 Social Media Snippets

Create short clips for social media using these visualizations:

### TikTok/Shorts (30-60 seconds)
1. **Hook:** "I built an AI to analyze CS2 players" (3 sec)
2. **Show:** `training_animation.gif` (10 sec)
3. **Result:** `model_comparison.png` + "88.7% accurate!" (5 sec)
4. **Demo:** Quick web app demo (10 sec)
5. **CTA:** "Full video in bio!" (2 sec)

### Instagram Post
- Use `model_comparison.png` as main image
- Carousel with `feature_importance.png`, `confusion_matrix.png`, `training_history.png`
- Caption: "Built an AI that predicts CS2 skill level with 88.7% accuracy! 🎮🤖"

### Twitter Thread
1. Tweet 1: Pipeline diagram + project overview
2. Tweet 2: Training animation + "Watch the AI learn!"
3. Tweet 3: Model comparison + results
4. Tweet 4: Link to full video

## 🎯 Key Metrics to Highlight

When showing visualizations, emphasize these numbers:

- **88.7%** - Best model accuracy (XGBoost & Ensemble)
- **1,500+** - Total players in dataset
- **30+** - Number of features extracted
- **4** - Different ML algorithms tested
- **3** - Player categories (PRO/HIGH/NORMAL)
- **FACEIT ELO** - Most important feature

---

## 🚀 Advanced Tips

### 1. **Picture-in-Picture**
- Show your face in corner while visualizations play
- React to the results in real-time
- Builds connection with audience

### 2. **Screen Recording Best Practices**
- Record at 1080p minimum (4K if possible)
- Use 60 FPS for smooth animations
- Hide desktop clutter before recording
- Use "Do Not Disturb" mode

### 3. **Thumbnail Creation**
Use `model_comparison.png` or `training_animation.gif` (first frame) as base:
- Add bold text: "88% ACCURATE AI"
- Add your face with excited expression
- Use high contrast colors (red + blue)
- Include CS2 logo or icon

### 4. **Engagement Hooks**
Throughout the video, ask questions:
- "Can you guess which feature is most important?" (before showing feature_importance.png)
- "Which model do you think performed best?" (before showing model_comparison.png)
- "What do you think my friend's result was?" (before showing his analysis)
