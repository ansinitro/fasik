## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Review the Video Script
Open `youtube_video_guide.md` and read through the complete script. It includes:
- Detailed chapter breakdown (0:00 - 11:30)
- Talking points for each section
- What to show on screen
- Filming tips and techniques

### Step 2: Prepare Your Recording
1. **Clean your desktop** - Close unnecessary apps
2. **Test your microphone** - Record a test clip
3. **Set up screen recording** - OBS Studio recommended
4. **Prepare demo data:**
   - Your friend's FACEIT username
   - Pro player examples: s1mple, ZywOo, NiKo
   - Your own username (optional)

### Step 3: Record Your Content

#### A. Screen Recordings Needed:
- [ ] Terminal showing data collection (`python pipeline.py`)
- [ ] Code walkthrough (VS Code with syntax highlighting)
- [ ] Web application demo (searching players, showing results)
- [ ] Your friend's analysis results

#### B. Gameplay Footage:
- [ ] CS2 gameplay clips (your friend playing)
- [ ] Pro tournament footage (optional, use royalty-free)

#### C. Voiceover:
- [ ] Record narration separately for best quality
- [ ] Use the script in `youtube_video_guide.md`
- [ ] Speak clearly and enthusiastically!

### Step 4: Edit Your Video

#### Import All Assets:
1. Screen recordings
2. Visualizations from `video_assets/`
3. Gameplay footage
4. Voiceover audio

#### Follow the Timeline:
```
0:00-1:00   → Intro (hook + project overview)
1:00-2:30   → The Problem (CS2 gameplay + explanation)
2:30-4:30   → Data Collection (code + visualizations)
4:30-6:00   → Feature Engineering (code + charts)
6:00-8:00   → Model Training (visualizations + animation)
8:00-9:30   → Web App Demo (screen recording)
9:30-10:30  → Your Friend's Results
10:30-11:30 → Outro (CTA + subscribe)
```

#### Add Polish:
- Transitions between scenes (fade, zoom)
- Text overlays for key points
- Background music (upbeat, tech-inspired)
- Sound effects (whoosh, ding, click)

### Step 5: Create Thumbnail
Use Canva or Photoshop:
- Base: `model_comparison.png` or `training_animation.gif` (first frame)
- Add text: "88% ACCURATE AI" or "I Built an AI for CS2"
- Add your face (excited expression)
- Use contrasting colors (red + blue)
- Size: 1280x720, under 2MB

### Step 6: Upload & Optimize

#### Title Options:
- "I Built an AI to Predict My Friend's CS2 Skill Level (88% Accurate)"
- "Can AI Tell if You're a CS2 Pro? Building a Player Classifier"
- "From 5 Hours/Day to AI Analysis: CS2 Machine Learning Project"

#### Description Template:
```
My friend plays CS2 for 5 hours every day. So I built an AI to analyze his skill level using machine learning! 🎮🤖

In this video, I show you the complete process:
✅ Collecting data from 1,500+ players
✅ Extracting 30+ statistical features
✅ Training 4 different ML models
✅ Achieving 88.7% accuracy
✅ Building a web app for real-time predictions
